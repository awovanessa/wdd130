        <p>
            Hello! My name is Awo Iwinosa Vanessa. I am a student at Brigham Young University–Idaho
            studying Software Development through BYU-Pathway Worldwide. I live in Lagos, Nigeria
            and
            am passionate about web development, UI/UX design, and emerging technologies. I love
            learning new skills and building beautiful, functional websites that make a difference.
        </p>

        <p>
            My journey in web development began when I discovered the power of coding to create
            interactive experiences. I enjoy both front-end design and back-end functionality.
            BYU-Pathway has been an incredible opportunity for me to grow academically and
            spiritually
            while pursuing my career goals in technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy reading about new tech trends, designing layouts, and
            collaborating
            with other developers. I look forward to completing the WDD130 course and building more
            professional projects to showcase my skills to future employers.
